## Architecture - (Client-server)
The Client-sever architecture works on a request-response model. The client sends the request to the server for information & the server responds with it.
Every website you browse, be web application is built on the client-server architecture. In this assignment, we are receiving data from the server which will be displayed on the client-side.


## My choice of the technology stack
In this assignment, I'm using react js. React js is popular. Most people are using it for the front-end instead of other frameworks. What is nice about it you can build small components which will make up a website. Also, there is a huge support for it if someone gets stuck or having a problem/error.
